# GAM - Associations between Longitudinal BMI and Biological Aging

This GitHub repository contains some of the R scripts used in Drouard et al., 2025.

_Gabin Drouard, M. Austin Argentieri, Aino Heikkinen, Miina Ollikainen, Jaakko Kaprio. Associations between 40-year trajectories of BMI and proteomic and epigenetic aging clocks: deciphering nonlinearity and interactions. medRxiv 2025.03.21.25324375; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.21.25324375_

The file _Analyses_R_ contains scripts to investigate longitudinal BMI patterns, estimate changes in BMI over time, scale clocks with RINT, run the main GAM analyses as well as analyses with interactions, and generate assumption and result plots. Please note that this script is a **modified version** designed to be **illustrative** while preserving data confidentiality. For details on the full dataset, please refer to the paper’s _Data Availability_ statement.
